                  <h2>SCIENCE</h2>
                  <P>I know nothing of life purpose but i know of passion and mine lies in science and medicine.
                      From the beginning i was the curious and ambitious child but when it came to science and medicine
                      it was like fish and water, because there was this melody and art in the books and experiments.
                      combination of all attracted my curious childish brain and now am here.

                  <h2>TECHNOLOGY</h2>
                  <P>There is power in technology that most don't see, actually tech has the ability to change the world
                      improve the standards of living and make a lot of work easier. that is the main reason ever since
                      i was  kid i loved playiing with devices, and for now i do my very best to educate myself about this world
                      to bring on the change i desire.
                  </P>

                  <h2>Athletism and bodybuilding</h2>
                  <p>when i was young, i was the go with the flow kid and somehow fat and weak compared to my agemates,
                      i despised it very much. in 2015 thats when i first joined my local gym, it was hard but as time went
                      i came to realise that bodybuilding and athletism are not just sport but also mental strenght training,
                      therefore i educated myself and ripped myself in order to create myself.
